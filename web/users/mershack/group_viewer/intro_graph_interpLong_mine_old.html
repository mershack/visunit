        <h3>Introduction</h3>

       <!-- In this experiment, we will show you a visual representation of network data and ask you 
        to answer questions about this data. 
        The network visualization will be on the left-hand side and the question and 
        other instructions will be on the right-hand side. -->

       
       <p>
        In this test, we will show you a network visualization of ingredients 
        (e.g. pepper, salt, meat) which have connections between them if they are often used together
        in receipes, and you will answer questions about this data.       
       </p>
        
        <!-- The network visualization will be on the left-hand side and the question and 
        other instructions will be on the right-hand side. -->
        
      
        

       
       
      <!--  <br/><br/> -->
      <p>
        There is a time countdown for each question, and we will hide the visualization once the time is up.
        You will have to provide an answer for each question before continuing.  
        You will be provided with your <b>turk-code</b> after you finish the study.          
      </p> 
        <!-- <br>  <br> -->
        <p>Try and answer correctly as fast as possible. </p>
        <!-- <br/><br/> -->
        <p>Tasks will be based on a node-link visualization of a network data. </p>

        <h3>How to interpret the Node-Link visualization for the tasks</h3>
       
        A node-link visualization shows networks as circles connected by lines. 
        For example, in the node-link diagram below, the highlighted node has four connections. 
        <br>

        <!-- is a network visualization that is used 
        to represent relationships between nodes or entities.
        
        The nodes are represented as small circles and a line drawn between 
        two nodes means there is a connection between them.
        <br><br>
        For example, in the figure below, the highlighted node (red node) has three connections. -->
        <br>
        <br>
         <u><b>Interactions:</b></u>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Panning: You can pan the visualization by holding the left mouse button down 
            on any white space in the visualization and dragging.
        </li>
        <li>
            Zooming: You can zoom with the mouse wheel on any white space in the visualization or by using the zoom buttons
        </li>
        <li>
            Selecting a node: You can select a node by clicking on it once. 
            Selected nodes and their links are colored purple.
        </li>
        <li>
            Unselecting a selected node: You can unselect a selected node by double-clicking on it.
        </li>
        <li> Moving nodes around when they are obstructing your view: hold the left mouse button down on the node,
            and drag the node around.
        </li>
        <li>When you hover your mouse over a node, all its links are highlighted green.
        </li>        
        <li> When you hover your mouse over a link, the link and the nodes that are connected to it are highlighted green.</li>
    </ul>
         The images below show an example of a selected node, a hovered node and a hovered edge respectively.<br>

        <h3>Tasks you will be performing for this study</h3> 
         <b>Task1</b>: You will determine which among two nodes has the highest number of connections.
        You will be asked the following question: 
        <b>"Given the two highlighted nodes, select the one with the highest number of connections"</b>
        
        <br> <br>
        
        <b>Task2</b>: You will find all the nodes connected to a highlighted node.
             
        You will be asked the following question: 
        <b>"Select all the neighbors of the highlighted node."</b>
        
        <br> <br>
        
        <b>Task3</b>: For two highlighted nodes, you will determine all the nodes that they are both connected to.
               You will be asked the following question:
               <b>"Given the two highlighted nodes, select all of the common neighbors"</b>        
        <br><br>
        
       
   
                       
        <br><br> You can see example task instances with answers for the tasks below.

        <p>Note: All nodes selected as part of each question are highlighted red and all edges of  
            such nodes are highlighted red as well.
