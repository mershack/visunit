        <h3>Introduction</h3>

            
       <p>
        This is a research study. We want to understand how to best show network data (items with connections between them). 
        We will use a matrix to show you how cooking ingredients (ex: salt, meat) are used in receipes together. 
        All ingredients are listed once vertically and once horizontally. Two ingredients are connected (used in many receipes
        together) if there is a black dot in the matrix at their intersection. The example below shows that beans are often used
        with bacon, while cheddar is used on broccoli. 
       </p>

        You can interact with the visualization. <b>Zoom</b> by using the mouse wheel. <b>Pan</b> by pressing the left mouse button down and
        dragging (as in Google maps). 
        <b>Select and deselect</b> ingredients as <b>answers</b> by double-clicking on them (either in the row or column headers).
        <b>Select and deselect</b> ingredients as <b>highlights</b> by clicking once on them (either in the row or column headers). 
              <b>Mouse-over</b> ingredients and links (the black dots) to highlight them.

        Here is an example of a selected answer, a highlighted row, a hovered row and a hovered connection respectively.<br><br>

        <img src="matrix-link-hover.png" height="180" />

	<p>We will ask you a few questions about this data. Please answer the questions as fast and accurate as possible by viewing
         and interacting with the visualization. There will be a <b>countdown</b> for each question; once it expires, we will 
         hide the visualization. We will give you a <b>turk-code</b> to use for payment once you finish the study.</p>

	<b>We will pay a $2 bonus to the user with the best overall accuracy/time.</b>
	<br><br>
        <b>The study includes two questions we consider to be easy enough that everyone can answer correctly. You need to answer both
        correctly to receive payment.</b>

        <h3>Tasks</h3> 
         <b>Task 1</b>: <b>"Given two highlighted ingredients, select the one with more connections."</b> <br><Br>
 	
	Hint: an ingredient has as many connections as there are dots on its row or column. <br><br>

         Remember, you
         can select and deselect nodes as answers by double-clicking on them. A selected answer node has a black border around it. See a few examples below:<br><br>
         <table align="center">
	   <tr><td align="center">Questions</td><td align="center">Answers</td></tr>
           <tr><td><img src="matrix-task1_qn.png" height=200></td><td><img src="matrix-task1_ans.png" height=200></td></tr>
           <tr><td><img src="matrix-task1_2_qn.png" height=160></td><td><img src="matrix-task1_2_ans.png" height=160></td></tr>
         </table>

	<br><br>
  
        
        <b>Task2</b>: <b>"Select all ingredients that the highlighted ingredient is connected to."</b><br><br>

	Hint: find all dots on the selected row and trace them up to their column labels. <br><br>

        Remember, you
        can select and deselect nodes as answers by double-clicking on them. A selected answer node has a black border around it. See a few examples below:<br><br>
       
        <table align="center">
	   <tr><td align="center">Questions</td><td align="center">Answers</td></tr>
           <tr><td><img src="matrix-task2_qn.png" height=160></td><td><img src="matrix-task2_ans.png" height=160></td></tr>
           <tr><td><img src="matrix-task2_2_qn.png" height=180></td><td><img src="matrix-task2_2_ans.png" height=180></td></tr>
         </table>

        
        <br> <br>

        <b>Task3</b>: <b>"Given two highlighted clusters of ingredients, select the cluster that 
            has the most interconnections between its members."</b><br><br>

	
        See a few examples below:<br><br>
         <table align="center">
             <tr><td align="center"><em>Questions</em></td><td align="center"><em>Answers</em></td></tr>
           <tr><td><img src="matrix-cluster_task1_1_qn.png"></td><td><img src="matrix-cluster_task1_1_ans.png" width="160" ></td></tr>
           <tr><td><img src="matrix-cluster_task1_2_qn.png" height="500"></td><td><img src="matrix-cluster_task1_2_ans.png" width="160" ></td></tr>
         </table>     
        
        
        
         
        
        
        
        <!--<b>Task3</b>: <b>"Given two highlighted ingredients, select all ingredients that they both connect to."</b><br><br>

	Hint: Two ingredients connect to a third if they both have a dot on that ingredient's column <br><br>

         Remember, you
         can select and deselect nodes by clicking and double-clicking on them. Selecting a node will turn it blue. See a few examples below:<br><br>
         <table align="center">
	   <tr><td align="center">Questions</td><td align="center">Answers</td></tr>
           <tr><td><img src="matrix-task3_qn.png" height=180></td><td><img src="matrix-task3_ans.png" height=180></td></tr>
           <tr><td><img src="matrix-task3_2_qn.png" height=160></td><td><img src="matrix-task3_2_ans.png" height=160></td></tr>
         </table>
