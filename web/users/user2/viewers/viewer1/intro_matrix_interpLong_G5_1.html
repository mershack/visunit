        <h3>Introduction</h3>

            
       <p>
        This is a research study. We want to understand how to best show network data (items with connections between them). 
        We will use a matrix to show you how cooking ingredients (ex: salt, meat) are used in receipes together. 
        All ingredients are listed once vertically and once horizontally. Two ingredients are connected (used in many receipes
        together) if there is a black dot in the matrix at their intersection. The example below shows that beans are often used
        with bacon, while cheddar is used on broccoli. 
       </p>

        You can interact with the visualization. <b>Zoom</b> by using the mouse wheel. <b>Pan</b> by pressing the left mouse button down and
        dragging (as in Google maps). 
        <b>Select and deselect</b> ingredients as <b>answers</b> by double-clicking on them (either in the row or column headers).
        <b>Select and deselect</b> ingredients as <b>highlights</b> by clicking once on them (either in the row or column headers). 
              <b>Mouse-over</b> ingredients and links (the black dots) to highlight them.

        Here is an example of a selected answer, a highlighted row, a hovered row and a hovered connection respectively.<br><br>

	<p>We will ask you a few questions about this data. Please answer the questions as fast and accurate as possible by viewing
         and interacting with the visualization. There will be a <b>countdown</b> for each question; once it expires, we will 
         hide the visualization. We will give you a <b>turk-code</b> to use for payment once you finish the study.</p>

        <b>The study includes two questions we consider to be easy enough that everyone can answer correctly. You need to answer both
        correctly to receive payment.</b>

            <b>Task1</b>: <b>"Which of the following ingredients is connected to both of the highlighted ingredients?"</b><br><br>
        
        See an example below:<br><br>
         <table align="center">
             <tr><td align="center"><em>Questions</em></td><td align="center"><em>Answers</em></td></tr>
           <tr><td><img src="both_connected_mat.png" height="250"></td><td><img src="both_connected_mat_answer.png" ></td></tr>  
         </table> 
         
<br>
         <b>Task2</b>: 
         <b>"How many ingredients are within two connections from the highlighted ingredient?"</b><br><br>
        
	See an example below:<br><br>
         <table align="center">
             <tr><td align="center"><em>Questions</em></td><td align="center"><em>Answers</em></td></tr>
           <tr><td><img src="two_step_mat.png" height="350"></td><td><img src="two_step_mat_answer.png" ><br>(bacon, kidney_bean, and their other 5 connections)</td></tr>    
         </table>

         <b>Task3</b>: 
         <b>We cannot show you the third task before you complete the first two.</b><br><br>
