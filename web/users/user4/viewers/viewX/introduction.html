        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <!--
        In this experiment, we will show you a visual representation of network data and ask you 
        to answer questions about this data. 
        The network visualization will be on the left-hand side and the question and 
        other instructions will be on the right-hand side. 
        -->

        <p>
            In this test, we will show you a hierarchical visualization 
            and you will answer questions about this data.       
        </p>

        <p>
            There is a time countdown for each question, and we will hide the visualization once the time is up.
            You will have to provide an answer for each question before continuing.  
            You will be provided with your <b>turk-code</b> after you finish the study.          
        </p> 
        <!-- <br>  <br> -->
        <p>Try and answer correctly as fast as possible. </p>

     

        <h3>How to interpret the tree visualization for the tasks</h3>
        Please take some time to review the following information on how to interpret tree visualization.
        <br><br>

        You will perform the task with either a radial tree hierarchy or a vertical tree hierarchy as shown in the images below
        <br/><br/>
        <image src="tree-visualizations.png" />
        <br/>
        A tree has a parent-child hierarchy, with the root being the highest
        on the hierarchy, and the leaves being the lowest on the hierarchy. In the radial tree, the root is the node at the center of the circle, and in the vertical tree, the root is the top-most node. 
		For example in the above visualization, the root node is "flare".
        <br><br>
            
        
    <h3>Tasks you will be performing for this study</h3> 
    <b>Task1</b>: You will determine if one node has more children than another node.
    <br> <br>
    <b>Task2</b>: You will determine the number of children a given node has.
    <br> <br>
    <b>Task3</b>: You will determine if two given nodes belong to the same immediate parent.
