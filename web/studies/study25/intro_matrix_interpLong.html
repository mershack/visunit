        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        In this experiment, we will show you a visual representation of network data and ask you 
        to answer questions about this data. 
        The network visualization will be on the left-hand side and the question and 
        other instructions will be on the right-hand side. 

        <br/><br/>
        There is a time countdown for each question, and we will hide the visualization once the time is up.
        You will have to provide an answer for each question before continuing.  
        You will be provided with your turk-code after you finish the study.
        <br>  <br>
        Try and answer correctly as fast as possible. 
        <br/><br/>
       
        Tasks will be based on a matrix visualization of a network data. 
        
        <h3>How to interpret the matrix visualization for the tasks</h3>
        Please take some time to review the following information on how to interpret the matrix visualization.
        <br><br>
        
        Networks can be represented as square matrices: network nodes are aligned as columns and rows 
        of the matrix; a black box in a matrix cell means that there is a connection between the 
        network nodes that correspond to columns and rows of the two nodes.
        
        
        <br><br>
        For example, in the figure below, the highlighted node/row <b>"Mlle.Baptistine"</b> 
        has three connections to <b>"Child2"</b>, <b>"MMe. Magloire"</b>, and <b>"Myriel"</b>.

        <br><br>

        <h3>Tasks you will be performing for this study</h3> 

        <b>Task1</b>: You will determine if two highlighted rows have a common neighbor.
        You will be asked the following question: <b>"Is there a common neighbor between 
        the two highlighted nodes? (Yes/No)"</b>
        <br><br>
        
        <b>Task2</b>: You will count the number of connections that a given node has. You will be 
        asked the following question: 
        <b>"How many connections does the highlighted node have?"</b>
        
        <br><br> You can see example task instances with answers for the two tasks below.
