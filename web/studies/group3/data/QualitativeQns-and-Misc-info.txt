A34L4JED8UAIXC		I was using Mozzilla and i had some display problems. sometimes the chart would not fully display on the screen. also there was not really enough time to adjust the display as i did not know sometimes what i was looking at and then the display disappeared. I was disappointed in not having enough time to play around with the display.		 : NL : MAT		1920		868		notRecorded		1.0,0.7,0.0		7.6,7.7,1.0		12,29,3,74,45,7,73,42		Tue Dec 08 2015 09:17:03 GMT-0500 (EST)
