        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        In this experiment, we will show you a visual representation of network data and ask you 
        to answer questions about this data. 
        The network visualization will be on the left-hand side and the question and 
        other instructions will be on the right-hand side. 

        <br/><br/>
        There is a time countdown for each question, and we will hide the visualization once the time is up.
        You will have to provide an answer for each question before continuing.  
        You will be provided with your turk-code after you finish the study.
        <br>  <br>
        Try and answer correctly as fast as possible. 
        <br/><br/>
       
        Tasks will be based on a matrix visualization of a network data. 
        
        <h3>How to interpret the matrix visualization for the tasks</h3>
        Please take some time to review the following information on how to interpret the matrix visualization.
        <br><br>
        
        Networks can be represented as square matrices: network nodes are aligned as columns and rows 
        of the matrix; a black box in a matrix cell means that there is a connection between the 
        network nodes that correspond to columns and rows of the two nodes.
        
        
        <br><br>
        For example, in the figure below, the highlighted node <b>"A 1"</b> 
        has a connections to <b>"B 1"</b> and <b>"C 1"</b>. 
        You can check a node's connections by inspecting the row or column that corresponds to that node.

        <h3>Tasks you will be performing for this study</h3> 
        <b>Task1</b>: You will determine if two highlighted nodes are directly connected.
        You will be asked the following question: 
        <b>"Are the two highlighted nodes directly connected? (Yes/No)"</b>
        
        <br> <br>
        
        <b>Task2</b>: You will determine if one highlighted node is directly connected to
        a specific node.
             
        You will be asked the following question: 
        <b>"Is the highlighted node directly connected to node "name_of_node"? (Yes/No)"</b>
        
        <br> <br>
        
        <b>Task3</b>: You will determine if two highlighted nodes have a common neighbor.
        You will be asked the following question: <b>"Is there a common neighbor between 
            the two highlighted nodes? (Yes/No)"</b>        
        <br><br>
        
       
    <u><b>Interactions:</b></u>
    <ul>
        <li>When you hover your mouse over a node (i.e. row-label or column-label), the node-label will
            be highlighted green and the background of that column or row will be highlighted green as well.
        </li>        
        <li> When you hover over a link (i.e. a black box), the nodes that the link connects to 
            are highlighted green, and the background of the row and column of those nodes are highlighted green
            as well.
        </li>
        <li>See examples of these interactions in the figures below.</li>

        <br><br> You can see example task instances with answers for the two tasks below.
        <h3> <u>Sample Question instances and answers for Task1</u></h3>
        Note: All nodes selected as part of each question are highlighted red and the column and row corresponding to that 
        node is highlighted red as well.
