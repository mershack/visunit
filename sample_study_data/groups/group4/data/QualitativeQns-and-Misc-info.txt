Then returned it, and accepted it again and thought i undertood - but maybe not.  Finding whether two ingredients are linked is easy and I get that part (although the time to do it is short if there are a lot of ingredients).  FInding shortest number of links between two highlited ingredients - I am not sure that I understood that one.  Any in two cases there did not appear to be a link.

A2EERJSPIAN07Z		I really, really didn't understand the instructions for the part relating to finding connections between the two highlighted ingredients. I thought it meant what links did they have in common, but I got the instruction questions wrong. If you had explained the correct answer I could have understood what I wasn't getting. Also, this program was VERY difficult to use. I had a hard time zooming in. I usually ran out of time before I got to answer anything. 		 : MAT : NL		1309		653		notRecorded		0.8,0.0,0.4		18.2,26.6,0.0		12,29,3,74,45,7,73,42		Thu Dec 10 2015 13:40:52 GMT-0500 (EST)
